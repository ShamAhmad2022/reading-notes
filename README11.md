3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.

## RBAC tutorial

1. What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.
    
    A: RBAC is a security model where roles are assigned to users, and each role has the permissions associated with it. The role determines which resources a user can access, rather than the individual user. Access rights are granted based on which role a user belongs to rather than the user themselves.



2. Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?

    A: After a user successfully completes the authentication process

3. Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.

    A: RBAC benefits businesses with improved security, scalability, compliance, cost savings, and productivity. It separates access rights from individual users, making it easier to control access to sensitive resources.
