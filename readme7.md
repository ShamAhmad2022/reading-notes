# Linked Lists

Linked Lists and big O are really important topics to know more about since I wanna be a fullstack developer, and since i specifically want to focus on working on the MERN stack.


1. what is linked list data structure?
    
    A: linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. Each node contains data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence1.



2. Why using linked list data structure?
    A: Linked lists are useful for dynamic memory allocation because they can expand or shrink as needed. They are also useful for implementing abstract data types.

3. How to use linked list data structure?

    A: To use a linked list data structure, you first need to create a node. A node is a basic unit of a data structure that contains two parts: data and a pointer to the next node. The data part contains the actual data that needs to be stored in the node. The pointer part contains the address of the next node in the list.
