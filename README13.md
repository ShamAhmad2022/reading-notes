Stacks and Qeueues are really important topics to know more about since I Sotware Engineering, and since I love to lean about Data Structures.

## Stack

1. what is Stack data structure?
    
    A: A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last

2. Why using Stack data structure?

    A: Stack data structure is used when the order of actions is important. They ensure that a system does not move onto a new action before completing those before

3. How to use Stack data structure?

    A: To use a stack data structure, you can use an array or linked list. The array implementation is simple and easy to implement but has a fixed size. The linked list implementation is more flexible and dynamic but requires more memory and overhead.


## Queue 

1. what is Queue data structure?
    
    A: A queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) for Stack and FIFO (First In First Out) for Queue.

2. Why using Queue data structure?

    A: Queue is used when we want to process elements in First In First Out order. It is useful when we want to implement a system that has to process tasks in the order they were received. For example, when we want to print documents in the order they were sent to the printer.

3. How to use Queue data structure?

    A: To use a queue data structure, you can use an array or linked list. The array implementation is simple and easy to implement but has a fixed size. The linked list implementation is more flexible and dynamic but requires more memory and overhead.
