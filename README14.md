After the reading I learned that Event Driven Applications is an important pattern to use in my code for a better handling of the app events

## Event Driven Programming

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
    
    A: Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away. We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported we’ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

    A: The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.This is where we can make use of Event-driven programming. By registering event listeners we can actually reverse the flow of communication between our objects.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

    A: Event Driven Programming is useful on the backend, since most of the backend code got the logic and hot to interact with the users actions, all that requires a better management by dealing with the events, and simplt the event is every interaction from the website to the user.



## Additional Questions

1. Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
    
    A:  APIs and Dynamo DB

2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

    A: to know moew about the topic because it seems that it's very useful and using it will help me a lot as a developer
