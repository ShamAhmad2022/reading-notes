# Data Structures and Algorithms
This topic is very important to me because every software engineer and developer should have a strong base in these topics

## Questions:

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

    A: time and space complexity


2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

    A: include a base case along with the rescursive case.

## Things I want to know more about

Eveything has to do with Data structure and algorithms, along with every software-engineering-related topics such as: software development methodologies.
